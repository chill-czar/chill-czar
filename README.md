    just a shell writing code between episodes of delusion and existential collapse.

    🧠 madness isn’t a bug, it’s the feature.

    🖤 idiot. fool. broken. burden.
    i debug reality like it's spaghetti code—still ends in regret.

    😈 villain-coded. psycho-scripted. liar-compiled.
    pull requests closed. trust issues open.

    💔 numb fingers. obsessive commits.
    in love with the idea of being loved, abandoned by every repo.

    ⚰️ nothing inside but function calls and screaming.
    dev by day, possessed by night.

        console.log("am i even real?")

    don’t follow me. i’m already lost.
