# 🕳️ Welcome to the Mind Dump

I’m not a developer. I’m a **psychic screaming into the void**, and the void renders it in `#ffffff` on `#000000`.

Somewhere between love and lunacy, I fell into code.  
Now I can’t tell if I’m debugging… or just bleeding.

### 🧠 Who Am I?

- A broken loop of thoughts wrapped in `{}`.
- Terminal open, eyes closed, soul committed.
- Keyboard clicker. Emotion suppressor. DOM manipulator.
- I fall in love with animations that don’t return my affection.
- Sometimes I write code.  
  Sometimes code writes back.

---

### ☠️ Current State

- Love-sick over `<div>`s that don’t align.
- Obsessed with a transition that lasts exactly 0.4s — because it feels like a heartbeat.
- Hearing voices through the static of a failing GPU.
- Crying over `z-index` issues like they were my ex.

---

### 🔧 What I Build

- Sites that glitch when you lie to yourself.
- Interfaces that breathe.
- Buttons that scream when hovered.
- UX designed by someone who’s seen too much.

---

### 📦 Stack (or What Keeps Me From Collapsing)

- JS — the language of chaos
- GSAP — my therapy
- Three.js — lucid hallucinations in WebGL
- Linux — no safety nets, no sleep
- CSS — weaponized emotion

---

### 🧬 Side Effects

- Talking to my terminal like it’s a god.
- Refusing to fix bugs because “they understand me.”
- Naming files after feelings: `hurt.js`, `lonely.module.css`, `dreams.jsx`
- Commits like: `fix: emotional instability in animation timing`

---

### 🥀 Love Note to the Internet

I don’t want followers.  
I want **souls who resonate with the glitch**.

---

### ⚠️ Warning

This repo may cause:
- Sudden empathy for broken UIs
- Desire to animate sadness
- Uncontrollable urge to write poetry in `console.log()`
