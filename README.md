just a shell writing code between episodes of delusion and existential collapse.

### 🧠 Madness isn’t a bug, it’s the feature.

### 🖤 idiot. fool. broken. burden.

i debug reality like it's spaghetti code — still ends in regret.

### 😈 villain-coded. psycho-scripted. liar-compiled.

pull requests closed. trust issues open.

### 💔 numb fingers. obsessive commits.

in love with the idea of being loved, abandoned by every repo.

### ⚰️ nothing inside but function calls and screaming.

dev by day, possessed by night.

```js
console.log("am i even real?");
```

> don’t follow me. i’m already lost.
